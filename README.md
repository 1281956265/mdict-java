in above example image,it takes 18ms to decompress the keyblock,in extreme cases the number can be 1000ms,e.g.,if you have over
1000 000 entries to parse.  
it takes 202ms to split the keyblock into key_list,in extreme cases it can be as long as 3000ms.  
the performance can be worse on the smart phone.  
# anyway,enjoy!~
